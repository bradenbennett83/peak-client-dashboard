---

## Typography

### Primary fonts
Peak Dental Studio employs a curated trio of fonts:
- **Inter** for headlines
- **Recoleta** for subheads
- **Inter** for body text

This combination delivers a strong, well-spoken voice that is bold and clear, balanced by modern neutrality and elegant versatility.

### Google font alternative
- **Source Serif** is the Google alternative for **Recoleta**.
- It has a similar vibe and enough variety to be used in all cases.

### Type hierarchy
This is how we use our typeface for fundamental elements. It guides the reader through the visual piece and looks nice and sleek.

- **Headline:** Inter Light  
  Example: “Dental Lab Work, Mastered.”
- **Subtitle:** Recoleta Medium  
  Example: “Precision craftsmanship meets predictable delivery”
- **Body copy:** Inter Regular  
  Example:  
  “Imagine the relief of logging off Friday afternoon knowing every case is in expert hands. No frantic weekend calls. No surprises when Monday rolls around. At Peak Dental Studio, we sweat the details so you don’t have to (Sub-1% remake rate and a signature 72-hour turnaround) to keep your schedule humming.”
- **Button:** Inter SemiBold  
  Example: “Start Your Partnership”

## Graphics

### Rhythm waves
Rhythm waves are the primary graphical element besides the symbol. They reflect the exactness of our lab work: subtle motion plus microscopic precision.

---

## Applications

### Social profile image
For maximum visibility, use the **symbol** as the profile image for social channels.

Placement rules:
- Keep an **X/2** space around the mark.
- The mark should be **So Rojo** on a **Midnight** background.
